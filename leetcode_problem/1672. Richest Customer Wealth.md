You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​` customer has in the `j​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ bank. Return _the **wealth** that the richest customer has.

A customer's **wealth** is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum **wealth**.

input: a matrix (array that hold a account, and array in a array to hold the price amount in each account)

output: highest total number

plan:
	have a array that hold each value
	we have two variable 
		n hold the length of the array
		m hold the length of the inner array
	we loop through the first array
		we make a total  value to see the sum amount of the first array
			we loop through the inner value of the first array
				add each value to the total
			we append the total to the array
	we return the max of the array


```python
class Solution(object):
	def maximumWealth(self, accounts):
	"""
	:type accounts: List[List[int]]
	:rtype: int
	"""	
	n , m = len(accounts) , len(accounts[0])
	totalAcc = []
	  
	  
	for i in range(n):
		total = 0
		for j in range(m):
			total += accounts[i][j]
		totalAcc.append(total)
		
	return max(totalAcc)
```

**Example 1:**

**Input:** accounts = [[1,2,3] , [3,2,1]]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation****:**
`1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
`2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation**: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
**Output:** 17
