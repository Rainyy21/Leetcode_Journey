You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return _the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the_ `kth` _node from the beginning and the_ `kth` _node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**)._
****
**Umpire**
input: head of a list and what to swap
output: head of the list of two value swap

edge case:
	what if there only k went out of bound
	what if the list is null

plan:
	we have two index
	we loop with the first idx in range of k
		we store the node in a temp
	than we loop until the first idx hit the end and second index 
		we will swap the value of the temp node and the second index
	we return the head

```python
class Solution(object):

	def swapNodes(self, head, k):
	
	"""
	
	:type head: Optional[ListNode]
	
	:type k: int
	
	:rtype: Optional[ListNode]
	
	"""
	
	idx1 , idx2 = head, head
	switch2 = head
	
	for _ in range(k-1):
		idx1 = idx1.next
	
	switch1 = idx1

  
	#moveing the both idx to the end
	while idx1.next:
		idx1 = idx1.next
		idx2 = idx2.next

	switch2 = idx2
	
	  
	#switch
	temp = switch1.val
	switch1.val = switch2.val
	switch2.val = temp
	  
	
	return head
```

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/linked1.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
**Output:** [1,4,3,2,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
**Output:** [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]
