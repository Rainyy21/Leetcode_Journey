Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.
****
**Umpire**
input: unsorted Array of number
output: return the length of the longest consecutive number

idea:
	we could sort the array first so we have number in order
	we have a counter and and a previous value
	if current == 
	 start looping through it
	 if i-1 = the previous
		 counter += 1
	else 
		counter =1
		maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)	 
	return max length

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,2]
**Output:** 3
