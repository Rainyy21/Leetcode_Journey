Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.
****
**Umpire**
input: unsorted Array of number
output: return the length of the longest consecutive number

idea:
	we could sort the array first so we have number in order
	we have a counter(starting at 1) and a maxlength
	we should have a edge case in case that num is empty 
		return 0
	we loop starting at idx1 and to the end of list
	if current == prev we continue so we skip it
	 start looping through it
	 if i-1 = the previous
		 counter += 1
	else 
		counter =1
		maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)	
	 %%in a case of it made it to the end without hitting the max%%
	maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)	 
	return max length

```python
class Solution(object):
	def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
	"""
	:type nums: List[int]
	:rtype: int
	"""
	#we first sort the list
	nums.sort()
	#counter at one to consider the first idx
	counter = 1
	maxlength = 0
	#check if the list empty
	if len(nums) == 0:
		return 0
		
	for i in range(1, len(nums)):
		if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
			continue
			
		if nums[i] - 1 == nums[i-1]:
			counter += 1
		else:
			maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)
			counter = 1
	
	maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)
	return maxlength
```
runtime: O(n)
space O(1)

can we improve on it:
what if we try to use set, we could check if the list contain 1+ the current set
we have the length = 0
we go through each each set
	# this would be the start
	if n -1 not in set:
		length = 1
		while(n+1) in the set : 
			length +=1
		maxlength  = max of length and maxlength
return maxlength

```python
class Solution(object):
	def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
	"""
	:type nums: List[int]
	:rtype: int
	"""
	setnums = set(nums)
	maxlength = 0 
	curr = 0
	
	for i in setnums:
		#look for the start of consecutive
		if i-1 not in setnums:
			#this will restart the count
			curr = 1
			#continue looking if their a consecutive
			while(i+curr) in setnums:
				curr += 1
			maxlength = max(curr , maxlength)
	return maxlength
```
it is O(n^2)
but it faster since it cut down a lot of duplicate

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,2]
**Output:** 3
