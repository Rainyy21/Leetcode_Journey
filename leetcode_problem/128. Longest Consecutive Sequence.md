Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.
****
**Umpire**
input: unsorted Array of number
output: return the length of the longest consecutive number

idea:
	we could sort the array first so we have number in order
	we have a counter(starting at 1) and a maxlength
	we should have a edge case in case that num is empty 
		return 0
	we loop starting at idx1 and to the end of list
	if current == prev we continue so we skip it
	 start looping through it
	 if i-1 = the previous
		 counter += 1
	else 
		counter =1
		maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)	
	 %%in a case of it made it to the end without hitting the max%%
	maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)	 
	return max length

```python
class Solution(object):
	def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
	
	"""
	
	:type nums: List[int]
	
	:rtype: int
	
	"""
	
	nums.sort()
	
	counter = 1
	
	maxlength = 0
	
	if len(nums) == 0:
	
	return 0
	
	for i in range(1, len(nums)):
	
	if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
	
	continue
	
	if nums[i] - 1 == nums[i-1]:
	
	counter += 1
	
	else:
		maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)
		counter = 1
	
	maxlength = max(maxlength , counter)
	return maxlength
```

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,2]
**Output:** 3
