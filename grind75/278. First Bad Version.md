#easy 
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Umpire**
input: 
	int: the range
output:
	int: the start of what bad

we could do a binary  search until one number or check if previous number is false than return that number

similar:
	binary search

plan:
	have a left idx and a right idx
		left  = 1
		right = n
	while l < r
		we find mid
			l+r // 2
		if isbad(mid):
			r = mid
		else:
		l = mid +1
	return l

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, bad = 1
**Output:** 1
